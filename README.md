Task Objective

The objective of this task is to understand how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset using Python.
The Iris dataset is used to explore data structure, statistical properties, and feature relationships through visualizations.

Dataset Used

1-Name: Iris Dataset

2-Source: Seaborn built-in dataset

3-Type: CSV-like tabular data

Features:

1-Sepal Length

2-Sepal Width

3-Petal Length

4-Petal Width

5-Species (target class)

Tools & Libraries

1-Python

2-Pandas

3-Seaborn

4-Matplotlib

Steps Performed

1-Loaded the dataset using Pandas

2-Inspected dataset shape, columns, and sample rows

3-Used .info() and .describe() for data understanding

4-Created visualizations:

5-Scatter plots for feature relationships

6-Histograms for value distributions

7-Box plots for outlier detection

Visualizations

1-Sepal length vs sepal width scatter plot

2-Histograms of all numerical features

3-Box plots to identify outliers

Key Findings

1-Dataset is clean and well-structured

2-Features are well distributed

3-Species are visually separable using feature plots

Conclusion

This task helped build a strong foundation in data exploration and visualization, which is essential before applying any machine learning model.
